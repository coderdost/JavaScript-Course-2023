console.log(myCar.__proto__);
```

**Question 2:** You have given an example of **OOP** Code. Your task is to explain the use of `super` keyword in `Dog` class.

    return {
      id: this.id,

      make: this.make,

      model: this.model,

      fuelType: this.fuelType,
    };
  }
}

console.log(
  new Car(233)

    .setMake('Honda')

    .setModel('Civic')

    .setFuelType('Petrol')

    .getCarInfo()
);
```

**Question 5:** What is difference between ** proto** and prototype property of Object? Try with **Example**?

**Question 6:** create class of `Person` with properties `name`, `age`.

Your main task is to add `static` method in that class of your choice ( e.g brainMethod)

### Assignments

**13.1:** You have given scenario. You are in **script.js** And in same directory there is another file **products.js**. In **products.js** there are two methods called **createProduct** and **deleteProduct**

- write an **import** and **export** statement properly in order to import these two methods from **products.js** file into the **script.js**

**Question 2** Now **export** only one method **createProduct** using **default** export statement?

**Question 3:** In **import** statement how can we **customize**/**change** the name of **function** we are importing?

Example : function is defined as `Addition`. We want to import as 'Add'
